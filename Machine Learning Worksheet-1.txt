11- Outliers are mailnly different from original data. Outliers values may be very high or very low.

there are several technique to remove outliers like z score, PCA, IQR

IQR=Q3-Q1
  The difference betn Q3 and Q1 is known as IQR,

Lower range is (Q1-1.5* IQR)

higher range is (Q3+1.5 IQR)

Values less than lower range or higher than hhigher range is known as outliers.

12- in bagging same type of predictions are combined but in boosting dissferent types of predictions are combined.

13- standardazition has mean 0 and standard deviation 1 where normalization has values betn 0 and 1

14 in cross validation we test and train the model. In cross validation we get correct performance report of a model.
in cross validation we use sub set of a data set.
